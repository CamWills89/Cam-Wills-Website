# Cameron Wills -  Portfolio 

## Description:
My name is Cameron Wills. I am a Fullstack web developer. I am from South Africa, living in Atlanta, GA, USA. The portfolio displays my personal bio to whom ever is interested in me for professional reasons. This will hopefully demonstrate who I am as a professional web developer. It demonstrates deployed apps/work that I have done, my Curriculum Vitae and how to get in contact with me on multiple different platforms
